REVIEWED: no

JOURNAL TR_m4_TT_Forgiveness
10: Nalvs Andolin told me to make a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Forgiveness in the Monastery of Saint Aralor.
20: The Shrine of Forgiveness is located in the cavern below the monastery, and can be accessed using the Penitent's Ring.
50: I have read the inscription on the Shrine of Forgiveness.
60: Nalvs Andolin is shaking me down.
100: (fin) I donated a single septim to the Temple, and in response Nalvs expelled me from the Temple. Turns out he does not have a sense of humor.
101: (fin) My contribution to the Temple coffers was deemed insufficient, and Nalvs wasn't very happy with me.
102: (fin) I made a contribution that Nalvs deemed sufficient, and he gave me a book in return.
103: (fin) Nalvs Andolin was ecstatic with my contribution to the Temple, and rewarded me with a book. He seems convinced my generous donation will be multiplied manyfold by the grace of the Tribunal.
