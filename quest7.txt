100: I have slain the cultists of Malacath in Hummurushtapi. I'm sure Nalvs Andolin would be happy to hear that.

100: I have found two dead bandits northeast of Arvud. Presumably they were the ones that ambushed the pilgrim.
110: I killed the vampires.

100: I killed the Ashlander chief, Vabal-Ajunta. Surely the Ashlanders had something to do with the death of a pilgrim in the Armun.

10: I am to go to Arvud, find whoever killed a pilgrim north of the town, and bring them to justice.
20: The people of Arvud suspect Daedric cultists in the shrine north of town, or the ashlanders to the northeast, were responsible for the death of the pilgrim.
30: An Orc in the Daedric ruin directed me to the ruins to the east.
100: (fin) Nalvs Andolin seemed glad that I returned from my expedition to the Armun Ashland, having made the presence of the Temple felt in the area, even if we might never be sure if we caught the pilgrim's killer.

10: The mabrigash in the ruins near Arvud deny having anything to do with the death of a pilgrim I was sent to avenge.
100: I killed the mabrigash northeast of Arvud. If they were responsible for the death of a pilgrim, they are no longer a threat.
